<h2>9-Bit: "How To Walk"</h2>
<a href="9-Bit_-_How_to_Walk.m4a">9-bit: </a>
<p>"How To Walk" is an intentionally lo-fi-esque, movemented score to tell a story. There is music for many situations included in this sampler that flows like a full soundtrack. As you listen a second time, you can hear how various parts can be stretched, looped, or extended for different parts of a role playing adventure. Clear your mind, put on some headphones, and stare at a wall for five minutes while you learn life lessons that usually take years of experience to possess.</p>
